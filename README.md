Thank you for downloading Igra!
 
This was my first real project and thus in need of reorganising. This is the last stable version (0.2.3). Executable also available under "Releases".

The game, as well as most associated files, are currently only available in Slovene. The game itself is a straightforward strategy game in which 2-4 players (or AI) fight over an 8×8 field. There are 4 types of units (Pehota - Infantry, Konjenica - Cavalry, Lokostrelec - Archer and Artillery). Each player starts with a fortress from which they spawn units. There are two victory conditions: either destroy all of the enemy bases or block all access point to them in order to prevent further unit spawning.

The game is playable, but far from complete. Due to several reasons, this version will not be developed further in favor of rewritting it in a not yet chosen game engine.
