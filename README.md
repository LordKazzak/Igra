Thank you for downloading Igra_v0.2.4!
--------------------------------------

Application has been translated to English, as was part of the source code. Several bugs have been fixed as well as default movement range of all units increased by 1 to improve game flow. No further updates are planned.

The game, as well as most associated files, are currently only available in Slovene. The game itself is a straightforward strategy game in which 2-4 players (or AI) fight over an 8×8 field (can easily be changed in source code by changing the value of Global.N). There are 4 types of units, each excelling in one area. Every player starts with a fortress from which they spawn units. There are two victory conditions: either destroy all of the enemy bases or block all access point to them in order to prevent further unit spawning.

It is possible to completely change the units by editing files in Properties/Units and assigning appropriate images in Properties/Images.

There are some status text issues, but other than that the game is playable even if incomplete. Due to several reasons, this version will not be developed further (except for fixes) in favor of rewritting it in a proper game engine.
